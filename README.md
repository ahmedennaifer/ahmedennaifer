- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ahmed. I'm a Data Engineer at opsci.ai, and a master's student at ESGI Paris studying the intersection of Big data and Artificial Intelligence!
- ðŸ¤– My coursework covers theory and practice on :
    - Reinforcement Learning
    - Deep Learning
    - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    - Statistical Methods
    - DevOps (IaC, Docker and K8s)
    - Spark Core and Spark Streaming (Scala and Python)
    - Cloud Services (AWS)
    - Project Management
  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Engineering, Data streaming and Generative AI and RAG systems, among other things ðŸ˜ƒ.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go, Kafka, Docker and GCP.
- ðŸ”¬ I have experience in building and optimizing RAG systems, Backend development, ETL pipelines, and AWS-based cloud services.

- Familiar stacks :
    - Backend : FastAPI, Django, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Pydantic.
    - Databases : MongoDB, DynamoDB, Redshift, PostgreSQL.
    - DevOps : Docker.
    - Vector Databases : Chroma, Weaviate, Qdrant.
    - Cloud Services : AWS Glue, AWS Athena, AWS EC2, AWS Bedrock, AWS Redshift, AWS DynamoDB. GCP Pub/Sub, GCP Cloud Run, GCP App Engine.
    - Streaming : Spark (core+streaming), Kafka.
    - Orchestration : Airflow.
    - ML/DL/RL : Tensorflow, Keras, Gym.
    - Generative AI : Transformers, Llama-cpp, vLLM, Groq, Ollama, Haystack, Llama-index, Autogen. (Also langchain, but i hate it with a passion)
    - Webscraping : Playright, Selenium, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup.
    - ML Adjacent : Pandas, Numpy, OpenCV, ROS2, Gazebo.
    - Programming languages : Python, Go, Scala, Java and a bit of JS.
      
- I speak Arabic, English and French fluently.
